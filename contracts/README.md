Hardhat contracts scaffold for Mighty Verse

Quick start (node & npm required):

1. cd contracts
2. npm install
3. npx hardhat compile
4. npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

This is a lightweight scaffold included so the repo has a starting point for contract development and local testing.
